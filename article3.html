                An Introvert is a quiet person that doesn't like to talk very much and likes to keep their thoughts mostly to themselves. They are kind of person that goes home just to relax and have time to think. But that does not mean that an outgoin1g person can't be an introvert. Just as they enjoy the quiet time to get themselves, they're most likely an introvert to a certain extent.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being an introvert is often considered weak. They aren't quite as good as the extroverts, who just seem to breeze through life.
            </p>

            <p>
                But that's not true, there is nothing wrong with being an introvert. The main problem is with society, which doesn't see it in the same way. Society has taught us that being an introvert is the worst thing you can be and that everyone should want to be extroverted.
            </p>

            <p>
                They are told that being outgoing is good and being shy and quiet is bad. They are told in schools to raise hands, participate in a class or we lose marks. For introverts, those are some of the very hard standards to achieve. Statistics say that 50% of Indian population is made up of introverts. So society is saying that 675 Million people have to change who they are to be accepted, to be successful and to be happy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Always remember within this large group of introverts are people such as Emma Watson, Michael Jordan, Albert Einstein, Elton John, Audrey Hepburn and so many more inspiring people. Being an Introvert has not stopped any of them from achieving their goals or being happy. Leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Rosa Parks and Mahatma Gandhi. All incredible leaders and all are introverts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being an introvert has no effect on how happy you or successful you are going to be as long as you see it in the right way. If you see yourself as an introvert and think its the worst thing in the world, you are never going to be truly happy with yourself. But if you accept yourself as an introvert and you're happy then there is nothing in your way of you achieving your goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                All in all, there is nothing wrong with being an Introvert. No matter what society may or may not say. You don't need to change who you are because being introvert is great.
            </p>

            <p>
                So the next time you see that quiet kid in the back of the class who doesn't participate very much, I want you to think “I wonder what great things they are coming up with next.”

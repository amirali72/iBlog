                This is a sentence that I usually heard from my friends back to my country when I shared with them how many hours I need to learn per day when I studied my master's degree at the University of Melbourne, the No. 1 University in Australia, and stands at 33rd globally.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the truth is
                Yes, I did it.
            </p>

            <p>
                And I feel it is normal at my university when most of the students are very hard-working. I also know some of my friends can study up to 15 hours per day.
            </p>

            <p>
                But for me, I don't want to study in this way and also don't want to recommend you to do it.
            </p>

            <p>
                And in this story, I want to share with you the way how I manage my day to optimize my study while not burning out. For me, study more is good but let you burn out just because of study is not a good idea.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are 6 tips that I did when studied my master's degree to make sure that I can get the best results for my learning process in 10 hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let make a simple calculation here. Every day, we all have 24 hours. So, let spend:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>7 hours for sleep</li>
                <li>2 hours for breakfast, lunch, and dinner</li>
                <li>1 hour for doing exercise</li>
                <li>1 hour for rest and shower</li>
                <li>2 hours for social activities (meeting friends, chats, â€¦)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                So you still have 11 hours for free to use for what you want in a day. And let say, you are a student and the most important for you is studying. This is all the time you can spend here. Let figure out how I use my 11 hours to work on my study journey.

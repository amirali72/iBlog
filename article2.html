            <p>
                If there's one thing that's really frustrating, it's being a slow typist. I know what it's like to be
                the person embarrassed because the world of technology was leaving me behind.
            </p>

            <p>
                Truthfully it didn't become a huge problem for me until I became a legal assistant at a very busy law
                office. Suddenly I had pages and pages of letters, memos, dictations, pleadings, and more that needed to
                be typed accurately and quickly. As someone who did not start out as the world's fastest typist, I knew
                I had to get better (and fast.) Using the below methods, I managed to pull my speed up from 55 words per
                minute to 90 words per minute in just two months.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Focus on accuracy over speed
            </h4>
            <p>
                When I was learning to type, I spent a lot of time trying to get the words out as quickly as possible.
                That turned out to be exactly the wrong approach. I would type really quickly and have dozens of typos,
                which took a lot longer to correct than taking my time would have. It's more important to get
                comfortable with the keyboard and type accurately than it is to type 85 words per minute right out the
                gate. This is mostly because getting really comfortable and confident that you're typing accurately will
                give you the mental boost you need to begin typing faster without thinking about it.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Stop with the hunt and peck
            </h4>
            <p>
                Hand position is an important part of typing. If you're learning computers later in life, that hand
                position may not come totally naturally to you. That's ok! A lot of people who aren't confident in their
                typing skills tend to type using a method called called the ‘hunt and peck.' This maneuver is when a
                person scans the keyboard for the correct letter they're looking to add before sharply tapping the
                keyboard with a single finger. This repeats until the typing is done or the person's coworkers file a
                formal complaint.

                There's no shame if this is where you're starting. However, learning to type with your hands in the
                proper position will allow your fingers to reach multiple keys much more quickly and will help increase
                your typing speed exponentially.

                While typing, your thumbs should be resting on the space bar. The four fingers on your right hand should
                be touching the H, J, K, and L keys and the four fingers on your left hand should be touching the A, S,
                D, and F keys. Make a note of where the heels of your palms are, and try not to move them more than half
                an inch when you're extending your fingers to reach keys on the keyboard.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Practice this phrase
            </h4>

            <p>
                There's a short phrase in the English language that contains every letter of the alphabet: “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” I recommend that you learn to type this without looking, because once you do you will know by virtue of having that sentence memorized where every letter of the alphabet is on the keyboard. It's an odd trick, but an effective one.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Use online tests and resources
            </h4>

            <p>
                The most obvious typing tip that anyone can give you is to practice, practice, practice. However, because I prefer giving specific and immediately useful advice, I have a few great typing tests, games, and lessons that I used when I was trying to increase my typing speed:

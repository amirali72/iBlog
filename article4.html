        <div class="article-content">
            <p>If you have a weakened immune system or have a higher risk of serious illness, wear a mask that provides
                you with the most protection possible when you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19
                in the hospital and new COVID-19 cases. Check with your healthcare provider to see if you should wear a
                mask when you're in an area with a lower number of new COVID-19 cases and people with COVID-19 in the
                hospital.</p>

            <h4>
                Medical masks
            </h4>
            <p>
                Also called surgical masks, these are loosefitting disposable masks. They're meant to protect the wearer
                from contact with droplets and sprays that may contain germs. A medical mask also filters out large
                particles in the air when the wearer breathes in.

                To make medical masks more form-fitting, knot the ear loops where they attach to the mask. Then fold and
                tuck the unneeded material under the edges.

                Wearing a medical mask doesn't increase the level of carbon dioxide in the air you breathe.
            </p>

            <h4>
                KN95 masks
            </h4>
            <p>
                A KN95 mask is a type of respirator that meets certain international standards. It offers more
                protection than a medical mask does because it filters out both large and small particles when the
                wearer inhales. However, be cautious when buying a KN95, as many fake masks are sold that don't meet
                quality requirements.
            </p>

            <h4>
                N95 masks
            </h4>
            <p>
                An N95 mask is a type of respirator that meets U.S. quality standards. An N95 offers the highest level
                of protection. It offers more protection than a medical mask does because it filters out both large and
                small particles when the wearer inhales. Non-surgical N95s can be used by the general public.

                The CDC has said surgical N95 masks should be reserved for health care providers. Health care providers
                must be trained and pass a fit test before using a surgical N95 mask. Like surgical masks, N95 masks are
                intended to be disposable. However, researchers are testing ways to disinfect and reuse them.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Cloth masks
            </h4>

            <p>
                A cloth mask is intended to trap respiratory droplets that are released when the wearer talks, coughs or
                sneezes. It also acts as a barrier to protect the wearer from inhaling droplets released by others.

                The most effective cloths masks are made of multiple layers of tightly woven fabric like cotton. A mask
                with layers will stop more droplets from getting through your mask or escaping from it.

                Wearing a mask doesn't increase the level of carbon dioxide in the air you breathe.

                If you wear a gaiter, make sure it has at least two layers of cloth.
            </p>

            <h4>
                What about face shields?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The CDC doesn't recommend using face shields instead of masks because it's unclear how much protection shields provide. However, wearing a face mask may not be possible in every situation. If you must use a face shield instead of a mask, choose one that wraps around the sides of your face and extends below your chin.

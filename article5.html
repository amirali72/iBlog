            <p>
                In terms of its size, population, and even wildlife, India is a land of incredible extremes. Some of the largest (and even some of the smallest) wildlife on the planet can be found across India’s vast array of rich mountains, verdant grasslands, luscious tropical jungles and forests, dense wetlands, and arid deserts. The country’s most prominent regions include the Himalayas, the Indo-Gangetic plain (named after the two northern rivers against which it’s bound), the Western Ghats mountain range, and the Deccan Plateau toward the south.

            <h4>
                Where to Find the Top Wild Animals
            </h4>
            <p>
                The state of India has set aside more than 500 wildlife sanctuaries and a hundred national parks to protect its wildlife. The largest and most popular parks are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Nagarahole National Park, located in the southern state of Karnataka, is one of the premier destinations in India. The lush forests, jungles, and marshlands are home to tigers, crocodiles, elephants, and aquatic birds.</li>
                <li>The Kaziranga National Park, located on the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River in the northeast state of Assam, contains buffalo, deer, river dolphins, tigers, and most of the world’s remaining rhinos.</li>
                <li>The Keoladeo National Park in the northern state of Rajasthan, which contains savannas and wetlands, is an ideal haven for migrating birds from Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, China, and Siberia.</li>
                <li>The Satpura National Park, located in the central highlands of Madhya Pradesh, is exceptionally rich in deer, including the Indian muntjacs, spotted chital, sambars, and blackbucks.</li>
                <li>If you’re interested in exploring the riches of India’s marine wildlife, then you might want to check out the Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park. Located near the remote Andaman Islands of the Indian Ocean, the park features plenty of fish, manta rays, and aquatic birds living around the coral reefs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
                The Most Dangerous Animals in India Today
            </h4>
            <p>
                India is home to several venomous animals and large, dangerous predators. These species are responsible for more deaths than many others:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>King Cobra – Native to the forests and jungles of eastern India, the king cobra can deliver a powerful toxin that affects the victim’s central nervous system. Symptoms include pain, vertigo, and even paralysis. Death can sometimes occur in as little as 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Saltwater Crocodile – As the largest living reptile in the world, the saltwater crocodile can grow up to 20 feet long. Its world-class bite and tendency to treat humans as prey mean that this crocodile should be avoided at all costs. Unfortunately, many people who wander into their territory every year are vulnerable to attack.</li>
                <li>Russell’s Viper – As one of the most dangerous and fearsome snakes in the world, Russell’s viper causes thousands of death every year. Symptoms of its bite include pain, swelling, dizziness, vomiting, and even kidney failure. Since it feeds on rodents and lizards, this snake will often wander into human territory.</li>
                <li>Indian Red Scorpion – The toxin of this scorpion will attack the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, causing a surprisingly high incidence of death. Symptoms can include vomiting, sweating, pain, convulsions, breathlessness, and an abnormal heart rate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
                Types of Birds in India

            </p>
            <p>
                The Bharatpur bird sanctuary, also known as Keoladeo National park, is famous for bird watching. Over 360 species of birds inhabit this sanctuary’s woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and wetlands. It is famous for critically endangered Siberian cranes. You can also find Indian peafowls, flamingos, pelicans, vultures, Indian grey hornbills, and so much more. The best time to see resident and migratory birds is between October to March.
